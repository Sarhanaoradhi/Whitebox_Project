# Whitebox_Regression_Project
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that explores regression modelling. The aim is to build, evaluate and interpret models in a transparent using a video game dataset.

##Project Overview

In the notebook, you will find the following steps:

Data loading and basic exploratory analysis

Pre‑processing of features (including handling missing values, encoding, scaling)

Model training and evaluation on a hold‑out test set

Interpretation of model outputs: coefficients, feature importances, residual analysis, and discussion of model behavior

Conclusion summarizing findings and suggestions for further work

##Dataset

The notebook loads the dataset (details on source, number of observations and variables are provided in the notebook)

Features include a mix of numeric and categorical variables

Target variable is a continuous outcome (regression problem)

Pre‑processing tasks address missing values, outliers and feature engineering

How to Run
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Sarhanaoradhi/Whitebox_Regression_Project.git
cd Whitebox_Regression_Project

# Launch Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook Whitebox_Regression_Project.ipynb


Run the notebook cell by cell.

Ensure you have the required libraries installed: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn.

The notebook is self‑contained: it walks through from data load to interpretation.
